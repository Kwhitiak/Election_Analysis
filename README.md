## Election-Audit Challenge Summary

The script used in thiis election audit allowed us to determine not only how many votes each candditate received but as well as each county.  This allowed us to see where mopst of the votes were cast.  Changing the script slightly and we will be able to determine how many votes from each county went to each candidate.  This script can also be used in any location by just updating the data with a different dataset to help determine the results of a different election.
